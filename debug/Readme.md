#1. project name:Raise yourself to study


#2-0. Project Description : Build self-esteem through self-directed learning.

#2-1.Features to Implement : It will implement the function of setting a goal for what to study and how many times from the user, the function of representing the user's goal as a study plan, and the function of sending praise and congratulatory messages through video when the user completes his or her goal.

#2-2.Why do you choose open source: I will use chatGPT and VLC media players as open source. ChatGPT has transparency and flexibility in code, so I think it is suitable for the function we want to implement. VLC media players support a variety of audio and video formats, so I think they are similarly suitable for the functions they want to implement.
